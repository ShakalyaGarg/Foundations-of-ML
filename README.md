# Machine Learning Projects Repository
This repository contains a collection of basic machine learning projects that demonstrate my foundational knowledge and 
skills in the field. These projects serve as a showcase of my ability to apply machine learning algorithms and techniques 
to real-world problems.

## Projects Included
1. **Image Classification** : This project deals with image classification using convolutional neural networks (CNN). It involves
training a model to classify images into different categories, such as recognizing different types of animals or objects.
