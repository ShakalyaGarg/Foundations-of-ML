# Image Classification Model
This repository contains an image classification model built using deep learning techniques. The model is trained to classify images into various categories, allowing for accurate identification and categorization of objects, animals, or other visual elements.

## Model Overview
The image classification model is based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, which is well-suited for processing and analyzing visual data. It consists of multiple layers, including convolutional layers for feature extraction, pooling layers for downsampling, and fully connected layers for classification.

The model has been trained on a diverse dataset consisting of thousands of images across different categories. During the training process, the model learns to recognize distinct patterns and features in the images, enabling it to make accurate predictions on new, unseen images.

## Example Application
To demonstrate the capabilities of the image classification model, an example application is provided in the repository. This application takes an input image, applies the necessary preprocessing steps, and then utilizes the trained model to predict the image's class or category. The predicted class and associated probability are then displayed as output.

## Dataset
The training dataset used to train the model is not included in this repository due to its large size. However, details regarding the dataset are as follows:

***CIFAR-10*** is an established computer-vision dataset used for object recognition. It is a subset of the 80 million tiny images dataset and consists of 60,000 32x32 color images containing one of 10 object classes, with 6000 images per class. It was collected by Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton.

You can use your own dataset or find publicly available image datasets to train a similar image classification model.

## Usage
To utilize the image classification model, please follow the steps below:

1. Download the notebook file ***Image_Classification.ipynb*** from this repository.
2. Open the notebook using a Jupyter Notebook environment or Google Colab.
3. Execute the notebook cells sequentially, starting from the top section. Each cell contains detailed instructions and explanations to guide you through the process.
4. In the "Testing with New Features" section of the notebook, you have the opportunity to test the model with new images. Simply follow the provided instructions and make any necessary adjustments to accommodate your specific dataset or image inputs. Also the folder *DATASET* contains some images used in the example application of the notebook.

By following these steps, you will be able to explore the functionalities of the image classification model and gain insights into its performance and accuracy. Feel free to modify the notebook as needed to suit your requirements and experiment with different datasets or image inputs.
